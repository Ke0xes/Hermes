# Hermes

In any large-scale cyber defense operation involving multiple Security Operations Centers (SOCs), the consistent and intelligent management of detection content is a cornerstone of scalable and effective security. However, when a central MSSP, Mothership SOC, Cyber Defense Centre or a similar central coordinating body attempts to harmonize detection strategies across several SOCs—each potentially operating with its own tools, processes, and priorities—it often confronts a complex web of operational inefficiencies and strategic vulnerabilities. These siloed SOC environments frequently lead to fragmented and independent development of detection rules. This decentralization, while sometimes fostering localized expertise, invariably results in significant duplication of effort as different teams unknowingly recreate similar detection logic for common threats, often with inconsistent quality, varying levels of fidelity, and a lack of adherence to universally accepted best practices.

The absence of a unified framework for rule creation, metadata standardization, and rigorous validation processes across these federated SOCs creates a heterogeneous and often unwieldy detection landscape. This makes it exceedingly difficult for the central coordinating body to facilitate effective cross-SOC collaboration, share critical threat intelligence rapidly, or deploy harmonized countermeasures against emerging, widespread attacks in a timely and reliable manner. Consequently, the overall cyber defense posture can suffer from blind spots and inconsistent protection levels across the organization or its constituents.

The lack of centralized governance and auditable version control for detection logic introduces substantial operational risks. Rules might be implemented in one SOC without the benefit of broader peer review or comprehensive testing against diverse datasets, leading to an increased volume of false positives that overburden analysts in that specific SOC, or, more critically, false negatives that allow threats to persist undetected within certain segments of the monitored environment. For the central coordinating body, tracking the provenance, evolution, effectiveness, and performance of individual rules across this distributed ecosystem becomes a monumental task. This severely hinders its ability to conduct effective troubleshooting, ensure compliance with overarching security policies, and drive a continuous improvement cycle for detection capabilities across all affiliated SOCs. As the organization grows, telemetry sources diversify, or new security technologies are adopted by individual SOCs, these challenges of coordination and standardization compound. The central coordinating body’s capacity to maintain an agile, consistent, and high-quality detection strategy across all its SOC partners becomes strained, directly impacting its ability to orchestrate a cohesive and proactive defense against an ever-evolving array of sophisticated cyber threats. As threats evolve and telemetry diversifies, the need for a unified system to manage detection rules becomes imperative. 

The **Central Detection Rule Management System (CDRMS)** (code name: **Hermes**) framework provides this foundation. It acts as the strategic and operational layer for governing the lifecycle, quality, and distribution of detection rules, parsers, and enrichment content across all SOCs managed by the central coordinating body. Fundamentally, the CDRMS is built upon the practical application of the 'Detection-as-Code' philosophy. This approach leverages software development best practices—such as version control, automated testing, continuous integration, and collaborative workflows—to treat detection logic as code, thereby transforming its creation, validation, deployment, and maintenance into a systematic and auditable process.

The complete Hermes Framework is under construction and will be completed in the near future.
